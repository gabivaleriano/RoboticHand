# 🤖 RoboticHand

The underrepresentation of women in hard sciences in Brazil is a known reality. This issue is also evident at the **Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA)**, one of the most prestigious higher education institutions in the country.

As part of the **STEM2D project**, the Bioengineering Group at ITA designed a hands-on initiative for high school students — particularly young women — to foster interest in STEM careers through bioengineering and interdisciplinary skills.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains the material developed for a **4-session course** where students assembled a **robotic hand** using simple materials. The course was delivered through collaborative efforts between ITA undergraduate/graduate students and public school teachers.

### Goals:
- Promote gender equity in science and technology.
- Engage high school students — especially girls — in STEM careers.
- Introduce students to bioengineering through practical and creative activities.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `roboticHand.pdf`: Final report of our work describing the course methodology and outcomes.
- .pptx files: Supporting files used in the sessions.
- .ino files: These are Arduino code files, also known as "sketches," that contain the instructions for controlling Arduino hardware.

## 📄 Results

The outcomes of the course — including feedback, photos, and learning insights — are documented in the `roboticHand.pdf` file. These results demonstrate the potential of active, inclusive education in promoting diversity in STEM.
